# Ad-Account Management System Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ad-Account Management System enables advertisers to create and manage advertising accounts with multi-user access control, budget management, and campaign organization. This system will extend the existing `adaccount` module to provide comprehensive account management capabilities while leveraging the established authentication, domain-driven design patterns, and event-driven architecture.

6. IF a non-owner tries to add members THEN the system SHALL reject the request unless they have Admin role

### Requirement 3: Account Status Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage account statuses, so that I can control account availability and compliance.

3. IF billing issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically set status to SUSPENDED
4. WHEN an account is suspended THEN the system SHALL prevent all campaign operations
5. IF an account violates policies THEN the system SHALL support TERMINATED status
6. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL publish an AdAccountStatusChangedV1 event

### Requirement 4: Budget and Billing Management

**User Story:** As an account owner, I want to set and monitor account budgets, so that I can control advertising spending across all campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting a budget THEN the system SHALL support daily and lifetime budget limits
2. WHEN budget is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically pause all active campaigns
3. IF spending exceeds 80% of budget THEN the system SHALL send warning notifications
4. WHEN viewing budget THEN the system SHALL show current spend, remaining budget, and projection
5. WHEN budget is updated THEN the system SHALL publish a BudgetUpdatedV1 event

### Requirement 5: Account Hierarchy and Organization

**User Story:** As an enterprise advertiser, I want to organize accounts in a hierarchy, so that I can manage multiple brands or divisions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an account THEN the system SHALL allow optional parent account assignment

3. WHEN viewing accounts THEN the system SHALL display the hierarchical structure

5. WHEN calculating budgets THEN the system SHALL support budget inheritance from parent accounts

### Requirement 6: Audit Trail and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to track all account activities, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and investigate issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any account change occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and user details
2. WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL show last 90 days of activities
3. IF sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication
4. WHEN exporting audit data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and JSON formats
5. WHEN retention period expires THEN the system SHALL archive logs according to compliance requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
